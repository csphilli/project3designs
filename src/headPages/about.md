hero_h2: Here's the TLDR
hero_p: Grew up in rural Wisconsin, moved to NYC in 2008 to pursue finance, had three sons, two of which required medical care of which I could only afford to get in Finland since they are dual citizens. Moved there, bought a summer cottage. Built a sauna, storage shed, out-house, terrace, and fence to name a few. Had to sell it but have been passionate about DIY ever since. I want to teach what I've learned over a decade's worth of time.

#### About

ding the twins. Began working in finance there nearly immediately and purchased a summer cottage. That was the formal beginning of my DIY skills and have been doing it since.

Quite finance in 2016 and began working towards a career in web development. In fact, I've used my skills to build this site.
