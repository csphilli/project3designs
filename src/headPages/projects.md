#### Projects

Grew up in rural Wisconsin. Relocated to NYC in 2002. Pursued Finance and began work on Wall Street in 2008 (just before the crash). During that, had my first son in 2007.

Had twins in 2008 and relocated to Finland in 2010 due to medical reason surrounding the twins. Began working in finance there nearly immediately and purchased a summer cottage. That was the formal beginning of my DIY skills and have been doing it since.

Quite finance in 2016 and began working towards a career in web development. In fact, I've used my skills to build this site.
