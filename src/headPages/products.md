meta_description: Build our projects with plans or courses
hero_h2: Every project we build is available to you in either the product itself, the plans for building it, or a course on how to build it.
hero_p: We offer plans and courses both free and paid. Plans are for the more experienced woodworkers who just want to dive in and tackle the project on their own. Whereas courses are for individuals who have the desire to take on the project but feel more comfortable having guidance along every step of the way.
